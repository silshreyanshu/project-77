   <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p> 
    <p>Visual Studio Code now opens a browser window for you and you can see the console. log message from the demo code in the Debug Console. You can use the Debug Console to do anything you normally do in the Console of the browser tools</p>
